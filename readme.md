## Sales Data Processing Project

## Overview:

This project focuses on processing sales data received in CSV format from various sources. The data arrives periodically, presenting challenges due to variations in column structures across different files. The objective is to develop a reliable process for validating and transforming the incoming CSV files to meet a standardized format, ensuring consistency and completeness in the output data.

## Problem Statement:

The primary challenge lies in handling the variability of column structures within the incoming CSV files. While some columns remain consistent across files, others may be missing or new columns may be introduced. The goal is to establish an automated procedure that accommodates these variations and ensures that the output files conform to a predefined set of columns.
Sample Data:

For this project, we will utilize sample sales data related to online sales of electronic products, including items such as TVs, refrigerators, microwaves, mixers, mobile phones, headphones, tablets, etc. The sample data will simulate the typical variety of products and transactions encountered in an online sales environment.
Final Set of Columns:

The final output file should contain the following set of columns:

    Transaction Date: Date of the transaction.
    Transaction ID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
    Item Code: Code identifying the product/item sold.
    Item Serial Number: Serial number of the item.
    Item Manufacture Date: Date of manufacture for the item.
    Sale Price: Price at which the item was sold.
    Discount Price: Price after applying any discounts.
    Store Number: Identifier for the store where the transaction occurred.
    Store Name: Name of the store.
    Customer ID: Unique identifier for the customer.
    Customer Name: Name of the customer.
    City: City where the transaction took place.
    State: State where the transaction took place.
    ZIP Code: ZIP code of the transaction location.

## Approach:

The processing system will perform the following tasks:

    Column Validation: Check each incoming CSV file to ensure that it contains all the required columns. Identify any missing or additional columns.
    Column Transformation: For files with missing columns, append default values to ensure completeness. Ignore surplus columns if present.
    Data Cleaning: Perform data cleaning operations such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.
    Output File Generation: Generate the standardized output file with the predefined set of columns.

## Conclusion:

By implementing a robust validation and transformation process, we aim to streamline the integration of incoming sales data into downstream systems. This will ensure data consistency and accuracy, enabling efficient analysis and decision-making based on the processed data.
